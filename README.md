# Introduction to Machine Learning Assignments - TUNI

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course assignments at Tampere University. This course provided a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts, and this repository contains the assignments I completed to apply these concepts in practice.

### Course Description
The course offered an in-depth introduction to machine learning, including topics such as:
- Fundamental machine learning algorithms and principles
- Supervised learning: regression and classification techniques
- Unsupervised learning: clustering, association analysis, and dimensionality reduction
- Basics of neural networks and deep learning approaches

### About the Assignments
The assignments in this course were designed to reinforce learning by applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems. They encompass a range of tasks including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implementing various machine learning models
- Model tuning and evaluation
- Data visualization and analysis

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
